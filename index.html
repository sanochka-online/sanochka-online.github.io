                                Hello, dear Hursana. Due to your pretty difficult position and situation, there will be long-distance information yet, because you only got 4 days before exam. 
                                When you have so little time before exam, you shouldn't focus only on one part or section of exam, neither you need to focus on one skill or type of question.
                                Thus said, here are my tips for IELTS, as I have experience in short-term practice))
                            </p>
                            <a href="./img/Cambridge 19 Academic.pdf">Cambridge 19 book</a>
                            <p>
                                It is the Cambridge latest book of mock tests(It is official and might come out on exam, though NEVER try to remember answers).
                                You will need to do first test fully like on exam(but you can do them separately), like listening(time-limited of course), then rest, then the reading and so on.
                                Your task for June 26 is to solve all sections on test(listening, reading, writing, speaking) and send them to me.
                                I recommend you doing them in textbook or notebook. After doing them, you send them to me, prefferably not looking at answers.
                                We will look onto your good and bad answers, locate the weak spots and practice them most!
                                That so-called self-reflection. When I was doing IELTS, I did only one such session, which boosted me so much and I think was suuuppeeeer beneficial.
                                For more information on each section I would like you to go to listening tab on left, then reading and so on!
                                This website will be fueling with more info later and today I only build the structure of it hahaha:)  
                            </p>
                            <span class="d-block text-right tm-color-primary">I now that you could have done better with practice, starting earlier, but do not think about it now. Though, I do not believe in locking in for long distance.
                                But you need to focus on exam these 3 days and I totally believe you will smash it! Believe in yourself too, hope and stay cool!
